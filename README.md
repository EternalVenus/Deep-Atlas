<h1>Deep Atlas</h1>

Deep Atlas will be a large scale object oriented programming project. 
We will be using OOP to model the real world or virtual world (video game).
This project will include all of the aspects of OOP such as Inheritance, 
Composition, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism and also Interfaces. 

<h1>Branch Note </h1>
Unfortunatly the master branch and the interface-abstract method branch cannot be merged
together due to their origin does not lay on the same branch. Now trying to manually merge
these two branches.

Created packages and src folder to increase organization.
